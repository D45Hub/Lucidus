Hey and welcome to my little demo page of the Lucidus Jekyll theme.
I made this one because I generally like those really simplistic webpage themes quite a lot.
The web sometimes feels like a bloated mess and it just feels refreshing to have something clean, simple and lightweight but also something that doesn't look ugly.

There are a ton of these super lightweight Jekyll themes out there but none really quite fit what I imagined so I made my own and here we are.

I hope you enjoy this little theme as much as I enjoyed making it.

Denis
